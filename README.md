# Mountaineer Data

The mountaineers web site does not easily answer all the questions that we have about trips.  
This program scrapes trip data from the web site, builds a database, and implements some
queries.

Work in progress.

## Tasks

[] Use CLI framework [typer](https://github.com/fastapi/typer) from the folks who made FastAPI
[] Encrypt passwords
[] Use [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
